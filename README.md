# NutriMind
NutriMind is a project I made for school. It is a nutrition logging app that allows you to use your own AI image classifier model to detect food and look up nutrition info.
NutriMind is built on top of the [TM-ImageClassifer](https://github.com/THEWHITEBOY503/TM-ImageClassifier) framework.
